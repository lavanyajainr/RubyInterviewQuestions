************************************************************************
1] frequency.rb 
Given an array of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. For example, if the input array is {2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 12, 2, 3, 3, 3, 12}, then modify the array to {3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 12, 12, 4, 5}. 

If frequencies of two elements are same, print them in increasing order.

 

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.


Output:

Print each sorted array in a seperate line. For each array its numbers should be seperated by space.


Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 70
30 ≤ N ≤ 130
1 ≤ A [ i ] ≤ 60 


Example:

Input:

1
5
5 5 4 6 4

Output:

4 4 5 5 6 
************************************************************************
2] ReverseWord.rb
                  
Given a String of length N reverse the whole string without reversing the individual words in it. Words are separated by dots.

Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases. Each case contains a string containing spaces and characters.
 

Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing the reversed String.

Constraints:
1<=T<=20
1<=Lenght of String<=2000


Example:
Input:
2
i.like.this.program.very.much
pqr.mno

Output:
much.very.program.this.like.i
mno.pqr
